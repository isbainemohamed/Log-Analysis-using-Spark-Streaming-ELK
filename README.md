This is an academic project which aims to create a data streaming pipeline using Spark Streaming, ElasticSearch and Kibana.
The workflow consists of generating continuous log data in a log file. then process it using spark streaming, the output is stored with Elastic Search and visualized 
in a Dashboard using Kibana.

- 🎯 We aim in this academic project to create a **data streaming pipeline** using `Spark Streaming`, `ElasticSearch` and `Kibana`.
- 👍 The workflow consists of **generating continuous log data** in a log file. then **process** it using **spark streaming**, the output is **stored with Elastic Search** and **visualized  in a Dashboard using Kibana**.
- 💥 Here is a small **tutorial** to **run the project** on **your own machine** :
